# Simple-Article-Analysis-Program-using-Python
This is a Python program designed to perform basic analysis on a provided text string.

Functionality:
- Letter Repetition: The program identifies three user-specified letters and counts their occurrences within the text.
- Word Count: It splits the text into individual words and displays the total number of words found.
- Text Inversion: The program reverses the order of words in the text string, creating an inverted sentence.
- Python Word Check: It searches for the presence of the word "python" (case-insensitive) within the text and reports its existence.
How to Use:
- Save the code snippet as a Python file (e.g., article_analyzer.py).
- Run the script from your terminal using python article_analyzer.py.
- The program will prompt you to enter a string of text.
- It will then ask for three individual letters.
- Finally, the program will display the analysis results for letter repetition, word count, inverted text, and presence of the word "python".
Requirements:
- Python 3.x
Contributing:
- This is a basic program and can be further extended. Feel free to modify the code to add functionalities like:

*Counting occurrences of all letters (without user input).
*Identifying the longest word.
*Finding the most frequent word (excluding stop words).
*Checking for specific user-defined words.
